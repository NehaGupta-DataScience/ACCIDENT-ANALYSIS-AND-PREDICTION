# Road Accident Analysis and Prediction using Machine Learning 

Performed the data exploration and created predictive models through machine learning. 

Attempted to create a multiclass problem to a binary classification problem using below mention classification models:
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* XGBoost

Performed the hyperparameter tuning with randomised search which improved the overall performance of the models.
