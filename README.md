ACCIDENT ANALYSIS &amp; PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
I have performed the data exploration and created prdictive models through machine learning models. 
I have attempted to create a multiclass problem to a binary classification problem. Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost were used as the classification models. Performed the hyperparameter tuniung wuth randomised search whivh improved the overall performnace of the models.
