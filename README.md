#Road Accident Analysis and Prediction using Machine Learning 

I have performed the data exploration and created predictive models through machine learning models. 
I have attempted to create a multiclass problem to a binary classification problem. Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost were used as the classification models. Performed the hyperparameter tuning with randomised search which improved the overall performance of the models.
